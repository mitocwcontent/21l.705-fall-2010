Course Description
------------------

Global exploration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries radically changed Western science, orienting philosophies of natural history to more focused fields like comparative anatomy, botany, and geology. In the United States, European scientific advances and home-grown ventures like the Wilkes Exploring Expedition to Antarctica and the Pacific inspired new endeavors in cartography, ethnography, zoology, and evolutionary theory, replacing rigid models of thought and classification with more fluid and active systems. They inspired literary authors as well. This class will examine some of the most remarkable of these authors—Herman Melville (_Moby-Dick_ and "The Encantadas"), Henry David Thoreau (_Walden_), Sarah Orne Jewett (_Country of the Pointed Firs_), Edith Wharton (_House of Mirth_), Toni Morrison (_A Mercy_), among others—in terms of the subjects and methods they adopted, imaginatively and often critically, from the natural sciences.

Course Requirements
-------------------

### Class Format

This class allows participants to develop a body of research on the scientific concepts, methods, and contexts that inform these literary works. We will use this research to illuminate the fruitful relationship between science and art during a period when such terms did not appear as divided as they do now. We will also try to become better readers of authors who read voraciously in many fields now often opaque to us. No special knowledge of science or the history of science is required.

### Assignments

The work for this course supports and carefully leads up to a substantial project requiring research, close reading, and critical thinking and writing.
